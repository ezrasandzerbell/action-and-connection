Dani Schulte will be teaching volunteers how to manually disassemble computers, peripheral electronic devices, and other electronic hardware. Manual disassembly is important for 2 main reasons: 1. Significantly reduces landfill-bound waste from electronics in comparison to mechanized recycling done by for-profit recycling operations. 2. Produces high-quality separated metals. Agenda: Dani will do a brief orientation with you when you arrive at 3:30pm. Must read, fill out, and sign the Volunteer Application  (unless you have volunteered here before). The Group Volunteer Form  must also be filled out. All the required forms will be emailed to the volunteers closer to the event. Please bring the applications and the Group Form when you come to volunteer! ",
