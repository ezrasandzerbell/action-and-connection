    <h5>About the issue:</h5>
    <p>President Trump closed the nationâ€™s borders to refugees from around the world, ordering that families fleeing the slaughter in Syria be indefinitely blocked from entering the United States. The order stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely, and bars entry into the United States for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries linked to concerns about terrorism. Those countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html"><em>New York Times</em></a></p>
